## **Design**
The different components and sub-components of _Common Cents_ and how they interact with each other.

### Architecture
The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `AccountListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/ui/Ui.java)


The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component
The Logic component parses and executes the commands. <br>

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/logic/Logic.java)

* `Logic` uses the `CommonCentsParser` class to parse the user command.
* This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* The command execution can either affect the `ActiveAccount` which in turn affects the `Model` (e.g. adding an expense), 
or affect the `Model` directly (e.g. adding an account).
* Based on the changes the command execution made, the `CommandResultFactory` generates a `CommandResult` object which encapsulates
the result of the command execution and is passed back to the `Ui`,
* In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteacc 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteacc 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteAccountCommandParser`, `DeleteAccountCommand` and `CommandResultFactory` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, their lifeline reach the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component
The model component stores the relevant data for _Common Cents_.<br>

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the CommonCents data.
* stores an unmodifiable list of Accounts.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `CommonCents`, which `Entry` references. This allows `CommonCents` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Entry` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component
The Storage component deals with save and load user data.

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/cc/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the CommonCents data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.cc.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo feature
This feature allows the user to undo their previous entry-level commands.

#### Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by `ActiveAccountManager` which implements the interface `ActiveAccount`. The `ActiveAccountManager` 
stores its previous state as an `ActiveAccount` attribute when a entry command is executed. On the other hand, the `ActiveAccount` sets the previous 
state as its current state when the undo commands is executed. As such, it implements the following operations:

* `ActiveAccountManager#setPreviousState()` — Saves a copy of the current `ActiveAccountManager` state as an attribute in `ActiveAccountManager`.
* `ActiveAccountManager#returnToPreviousState()` — Restores the previous `ActiveAccountManager` state from its attribute.

These operations are exposed in the `ActiveAccount` interface as `ActiveAccount#setPreviousState()` and `ActiveAccount#returnToPreviousState()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Prelude. When the user first runs _Common Cents_, `ActiveAccountManager` does not store any previous states as shown in the diagram below.

![UndoState0](images/UndoState0.png)

Step 1. The user executes `delete 5 c/expense` command to delete the 5th expense in the expense list in the Account in `ActiveAccountManager`. The `delete` command calls `ActiveAccountManager#setPreviousState()` initially, 
causing a copy of the `ActiveAccountManager` state before the `delete 5 c/expense` command executes to be saved as an attribute. After this, the `delete 5 c/expense` command executes and the
model is updated according to the modified account in ActiveAccount.

![UndoState1](images/UndoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add c/expense …​` to add a new expense. The `add` command calls `ActiveAccountManager#setPreviousState()` initially, 
causing a copy of the `ActiveAccountManager` state before the command executes to be saved as an attribute. After this, the `add c/expense …​` command executes and the
model is updated according to the modified account in ActiveAccount.

![UndoState2](images/UndoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `ActiveAccountManager#setPreviousState()`, so the state will not be saved into its attribute.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `ActiveAccountManager#returnToPreviousState()`, 
which will set data of the previous state attribute to the current `ActiveAccountManager`. 

![UndoState3](images/UndoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `ActiveAccountManager` does not have a previous state 
(i.e The `previousState` attribute in `ActiveAccountManager` is empty) then there are no previous `ActiveAccountManager` states to restore. 
The `undo` command uses `Model#hasNoPreviousState()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**:

 * The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
 * Some of the interactions with the utility classes, such as `CommandResult`, `CommandResultFactory` and `Storage` are left out of the sequence diagram as their roles are not significant in the execution
   of the undo command. 
   
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `ActiveAccountManager#setPreviousState()` is only called in `add`, `delete`, `edit`, and `clear` commands. 
Hence, the `undo` command only works on the previously stated commands which interacts with entries.

</div>

#### Design consideration
Explanation why a certain design is chosen.

##### Aspect: How undo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ActiveAccount.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: 
    * May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. 
    * Only allow undo command to work for commands dealing with entries.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire Model and ActiveAccount 
  * Pros: More commands can be undone, for instance commands dealing with accounts.
  * Cons: 
    * May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. 
    * We must ensure that the implementation avoids unnecessary changes to Model or ActiveAccount that can result in errors.

* **Alternative 3:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the entry being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Edit account feature
This feature allows the user to edit the information of a specific existing entry.

#### Implementation
The proposed edit account mechanism is facilitated by `EditAccountCommand`. It extends `Command` and is identified by
`CommonCentsParser` and `EditAccountCommandParser`. The `EditAccountCommand` interacts with `Account` and the interaction
is managed by `ActiveAccount` as well as the `Model`. As such, it implements the following operation:

* `Account#setName(Name editedName)` — Sets the name of the account

This operation is exposed in the `ActiveAccount` interface as `ActiveAccount#setName()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit account mechanism behaves at each step.

* Step 1: The user inputs the edit command to edit the current account in `ActiveAccount`. `CommonCentsParser` identifies
the command word and calls `EditCommandParser#parse(String args)` to parse the input into a valid `EditAccountCommand`

* Step 2: `EditAccountCommand` starts to be executed. In the execution, the current account, namely `previousAccount`
in `ActiveAccount` is retrieved.

* Step 3: `ActiveAccount#setName(Name editedName)` is called with the edited name to replace the name of the current
account in `ActiveAccount`.

* Step 4: The updated account, namely `newAccount`, in `ActiveAccount` is retrieved.

* Step 5: `Model#setAccount(Account target, Account editedAccount)` is called with `previousAccount` as `target`, and
`newAccount` as `editedAccount`. This is to replace the to-be-edited account in the Model with the edited account.

The following sequence diagram shows how an edit account operation works:

![EditAccountSequenceDiagram](images/EditAccountSequenceDiagram.png)

![EditAccountSequenceRefDiagram](images/EditAccountSequenceRefDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**

* The lifeline for `EditAccountCommandParser` and `EditAccountCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, their lifeline reach the end of diagram.
* The reference diagram should have the notation on the top left corner, but due to a limitation of PlantUML, a title is used to replace the notation.
* Some of the interactions with the utility classes, such as `CommandResult`, `CommandResultFactory` and `Storage` are left out of the sequence diagram as their roles are not significant in the execution
of the edit account command. 

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![EditAccountActivityDiagram](images/EditAccountActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration
Explanation why a certain design is chosen.

##### Aspect: How edit account executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accounts can only be edited if they are active.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Less flexibility for user.

* **Alternative 2:** Accounts can be edited by retrieving them from the account list with an index input.
  * Pros: More flexibility for user.
  * Cons: It is difficult to implement and manage because we need to consider whether the account to be edited
  is active and add extra measures for that case. As such, we chose alternative one since it is a more elegant
  solution.
  
##### Aspect: Mutability of account
* **Choice:** Allowing name attribute of Account to be mutated by EditCommand.
  * Rationale: Initially, we implemented the name attribute of Account to be immutable. However, we realize that it
  is difficult to edit the name of the account if it is immutable. Hence, to overcome this obstacle, we decided
  to make the name attribute mutable.
  * Implications: Extra precaution needs to be implemented, for instance creating copies of account in methods that interacts
  with the accounts to prevent unnecessary changes to accounts in account list. Hence, it resulted in more defensive coding 
  which resulted in more lines of code.

### Find entries feature 
*(Written by Le Hue Man)*
This feature allows the user to find specific existing entries using a given keyword.
  
#### Implementation

The Find entries feature is facilitated by `FindCommand`. It extends `Command` and 
is identified by `CommonCentsParser` and `FindCommandParser`. The FindCommand interacts 
with `Account` and the interactions are managed by `ActiveAccount`. As such, it implements the following
operations: 
* `Account#updateFilteredExpenseList(Predicate<Expense> predicate)` — Updates the expense 
list that has the given keywords as predicate.
* `Account#updateFilteredRevenueList(Predicate<Revenue> predicate)` — Updates the revenue 
list that has the given keywords as predicate. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find entries mechanism behaves 
at each step.

* Step 1. The user inputs the find command to find the entries that have the occurrences of 
a list of specified keywords in the entries of `ActiveAccount`. `CommandParser` identifies the command word `find`
and calls `FindCommandParser#parse(String args)` to parse the input into a valid `FindCommand`.

* Step 2. `FindCommand` starts to be executed. In the execution, 
    * If there is a predicate for keywords in the expense list of `ActiveAccount`, the expense list is updated. 
    `ActiveAccount#updateFilteredExpenseList()` is called to update the current expense list with expenses 
    with descriptions matching the keywords. 
    * If there is a predicate for keywords in the revenue list of `ActiveAccount`, the revenue list is updated. 
    `ActiveAccount#updateFilteredExpenseList()` is called to update the current revenue list with revenues
    with descriptions matching the keywords.

The following sequence diagram shows how a find entry operation works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Some of the interactions with the utility classes,
such as `CommandResult` and `Storage` are left out of the sequence diagram as their roles are not significant in the execution
of the find entries command.
</div>

#### Design consideration
Explanation why a certain design is chosen.

##### Aspect: How find entries command is parsed
* **Choice:** User needs to use prefix "k/" to before the keywords.
    * Pros: 
        * Easy to implement as the arguments can be tokenized in the event of inputs with multiple arguments.
        * Able to handle multiple arguments as input for Category (with prefix "c/") is optional.
    * Cons: Less convenience for the user. 

### Calculate net profits feature

#### Implementation
The calculate net profits mechanism is facilitated by `GetProfitCommand`. It extends `Command` and is identified by `CommonCentsParser`. The `GetProfitCommand` interacts with `Account` and the interaction is managed by `ActiveAccount`. As such, it implements the following operations:   

* `Account#getProfits()` — gets the net profit from the total expenses and revenues in the account
* `Account#getTotalExpenses()` — gets the total sum of all the expenses in the account
* `Account#getTotalRevenue()` — gets the total sum of all the revenues in the account

The operation is exposed in the `ActiveAccount` interface as `ActiveAccount#getProfits()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calculate net profits mechanism behaves at each step.

* Step 1. The user inputs the profit command to calculate the net profits in the current account in ActiveAccount. `CommonCentsParser` identifies the command word and calls a valid `GetProfitCommand`.

* Step 2. `GetProfitCommand` starts to be executed. In the execution, `ActiveAccount#getProfits()` is called to calculate the net profits. 
    * `Account#getTotalExpense()` and `Account#getTotalRevenue()` are called in `ActiveAccount#getProfits` to get the total expenses and total revenues. The net profit is then calculated by subtracting the difference.

The following sequence diagram shows how a calculate net profits operation works: 

![CalculateProfitSequenceDiagram](images/CalculateProfitSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**:

 * The lifeline for `GetProfitCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
 * Some of the interactions with the utility classes, such as `CommandResult`, `CommandResultFactory` and `Storage` are left out of the sequence diagram as their roles are not significant in the execution
   of the get profit command. 
   
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CalculateProfitActivityDiagram](images/CalculateProfitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration
Explanation why a certain design is chosen.

##### Aspect: How calculate net profits executes:
* Choice: Calculates the net profits by retrieving the expense and revenue lists from the account. 
    * Pros: Easy to implement

## **Appendix: Effort**
This section highlights the team effort to build _Common Cents_ from AB3. While it was not easy, it was a fufilling and valuable experience for all of us.

### Effort
* Total of 10kLoC written.
* Total 245 hours of work: 7 hours spent per person (total 5 of us) per week.
* ~30 pages of UG
* ~40 pages of DG

### Challenges

#### Management
* During v1.2 iterations, the deadlines were not set properly and we struggled to produce a working app in that iteration. From there, we learnt to set internal deadlines and longer buffer periods in v1.3 and v1.4.
* Documentation was not updated regularly as the focus was on the code.

#### Coding
* We had to modify the OOP structure of AB3 to include another layer of logic, which is the Account and ActiveAccount layer. 
* It was difficult to maintain relatively high code coverage for JUnit tests as many new classes were added through the iterations.
* JavaFX was a foreign library to learn and apply in the application.
* Much defensive coding had to be implemented to avoid unnecessary mutability of variables.

### Milestones
* Week 7: Started to modify AB3
* Week 8: UI design is completed
* Week 9: First successful run of _Common Cents_
* Week 10: Release of v1.2.1
* Week 11: Completion of v1.3 of _Common Cents_ and first draft of UG/DG
* Week 11: Release of v1.3
* Week 12: Completion of v1.4 of _Common Cents_
* Week 13: Release of v1.4 and submission of final draft of UG/DG
